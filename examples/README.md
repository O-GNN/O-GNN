# OGB Examples

We provide baseline experiments/example scripts for **[node property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/nodeproppred)**, **[link property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/linkproppred)** and **[graph property prediction tasks](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/graphproppred)** on *all* datasets currently included in OGB.
We additionally provide **[our baseline code](https://github.com/snap-stanford/ogb/tree/master/examples/lsc)** for our **[OGB-LSC @ KDD Cup 2021](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/)**.

Each dataset is hosted in its own folder and provides separate examples for each individual model.
Unless otherwise specified, the default hyper-parameters are what we used to generate the results in our paper and leaderboards.
Please read their respective `README.md` files for further information on how to run them.
